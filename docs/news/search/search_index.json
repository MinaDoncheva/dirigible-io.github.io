To reinforce this initiative Eclipse Foundation created at the end of last year a private area comprising several existing project (Orion and Flux), and two new (Che and Dirigible ). Companies that stand behind the support for this initiative originally IBM, SAP, Pivotal, Codenvy, WSO2 and Redhat.

What is it? In short this is a place at GitHub https://github.com/dirigiblelabs where developers can collaborate and openly share their projects built with and run on Eclipse Dirigible. There are some important points, which have to be emphasized: The projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects The developers must not use Eclipse provided collaboration and project management services e.g Bugzilla, IPzilla, Forum, Wiki, etc. The projects are not obliged to follow the Eclipse IP process Looks like a regular GitHub collaboration space? The only key difference is that: The developers have to sign the Eclipse CLA Why? This will give us confidence about the authors of the contributed source code and will make the eventual contribution to Eclipse Dirigible project at later point of time much easier. The full description of the User Guidelines can be found at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Dirigible/DirigibleLabs Sounds easy, right? You always can use the http://trial.dirigible.io as a starting point.
